# This tool uses gnuradio to generate FIR filter taps
# that can be used for the FIRFilter function in
# CRC DabMod
#
# Usage:
#  1) adapt the filter settings below
#  2) Call this script and redirect the output of this script into a file
#
# Requires:
#  A recent gnuradio version (3.7)

# use "window method" to design a low-pass FIR filter
#
# gain: overall gain of filter (typically 1.0)
# sampling_freq: sampling freq (Hz)
# cutoff_freq: center of transition band (Hz)
# transition_width: width of transition band (Hz).
#    The normalized width of the transition band is what sets the number of taps required. Narrow --> more taps
# window_type: What kind of window to use. Determines maximum attenuation and passband ripple.
# beta: parameter for Kaiser window
